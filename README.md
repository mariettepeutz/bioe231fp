# The Dengue Destroyers

This project provides a customizable database installer for JBrowse2, focused on the Dengue virus, to support pandemic researchers by integrating genome alignments and annotations for evolutionary analysis.

## Instructions for running the script:

1. Clone the repository containing the script:
   
        git clone https://github.com/mariettepeutz/bioe231fp.git

2. Move into the repository directory:

        cd bioe231fp
   
4. Install all necessary dependencies:
   Based on your operating system, run the appropriate command to install wget, samtools, bowtie2, jbrowse, and other essential tools:

   For macOS:

       bash mac_requirements.sh
   For Linux:
   
       bash linux_requirements.sh

6. Set the APACHE_ROOT environment variable:
   Ensure you have created the `APACHE_ROOT` environment variable pointing to your Apache root directory.

      Example:
   
       export APACHE_ROOT='/path/to/apache/root'

   For a normal linux installation, the folder should be /var/www or /var/www/html, whereas when you install on macOS using brew it will likely be in /opt/homebrew/var/www (for M1) or /usr/local/var/www (for Intel). You can run brew --prefix to get the brew install location, and then from there it is in the var/www folder.

   If you're unsure of the correct path, run the following command to locate your Apache root directory:
   
       sudo find / -name "www" 2>/dev/null

7. Download and copy over JBrowse 2 into the apache2 root dir, setting the owner to the current user with chown:

       jbrowse create output_folder
       sudo mv output_folder $APACHE_ROOT/jbrowse2
       sudo chown -R $(whoami) $APACHE_ROOT/jbrowse2

8. Test your JBrowse2 installation by opening the browser and typing in:

   For mac:
   
         http://localhost:8080/jbrowse2/

   For AWS: (xx.xxx.xxx.xx is your IP address)
   
         http://xx.xxx.xxx.xx/jbrowse2/

   For Linux: (xx.xxx.xxx.xx is your IP address)
   
         http://xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8080/jbrowse2/

10. Make the script executable:

        chmod +x main.sh

11. Run the script:

        ./main.sh

12. Navigate again to your JBrowse installation to see your final visualization of the viral genomes:

   For mac:
   
         http://localhost:8080/jbrowse2/

   For AWS: (xx.xxx.xxx.xx is your IP address)
   
         http://xx.xxx.xxx.xx/jbrowse2/

   For Linux: (xx.xxx.xxx.xx is your IP address)
   
         http://xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8080/jbrowse2/

## Dengue Virus(DENV)

An increasing and major global health threat, with over 6,800 cases reported in the United States as of October 31, 2024—more than double the cases reported in 2023—driven by climate change expanding mosquito habitats and contributing to outbreaks in new regions, specifically in the Americas and Asia.

## Data Sources

### **External Data Sources**:
- Genome sequences and annotations were retrieved from the NCBI FTP repository.
- Specific data includes genomic FASTA files and GFF annotation files for Dengue.

#### **Example Links**:
- **Dengue**: [NCBI Genome Reference](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/862/125/GCF_000862125.1_ViralProj15306/)

### **Self-Generated Data**:
- Alignments between reference and comparison genomes.

## JBrowse Usage Guide

### **Navigating JBrowse2**
- **Reading Frames**: Explore six reading frames (three forward and three reverse).
- **Annotation Tracks**: View genome annotations (e.g., genes, regulatory regions).
- **Alignment Tracks**: Analyze alignment tracks for insights into different viral strains.
