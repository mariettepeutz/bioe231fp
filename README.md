# The Flavi Fighters
## BioE231 Final Project by Smrithi Surender, Marriëtte Peutz, & Kate Barouch

### This project provides a customizable database installer for JBrowse2, focused on the Flavivirus family, to support pandemic researchers by integrating genome alignments, annotations, and bioinformatics tools for rapid pathogen identification and evolutionary analysis.

### We chose to focus on the Flavivirus family due to the increasing global health threats posed by viruses like Dengue and Zika, with climate warming expanding mosquito habitats and contributing to outbreaks in new regions.
